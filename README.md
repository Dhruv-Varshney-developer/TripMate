## ðŸš§ Development Note
This project was initially started by importing code from the `browser-use` repository, as we intended to build on top of their library. However, during development, we realized that the library didnâ€™t fulfill our needs, so we removed the original code and rebuilt everything natively from scratch to better align with our goals.
